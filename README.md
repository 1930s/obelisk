## Installation
1. Set up nix caches
    1. Add this to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:
        ```
        nix.binaryCaches = [ "https://nixcache.reflex-frp.org" ];
        nix.binaryCachePublicKeys = [ "ryantrinkle.com-1:JJiAKaRv9mWgpVAz8dwewnZe0AzzEAzPkagE9SP5NWI=" ];
        ```
1. Get set up to access private repositories
    1. [Get set up to connect to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)
    1. [Create a GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
    1. Add this to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:
        ```
        nix.envVars = {
          NIX_GITHUB_PRIVATE_USERNAME = "your-github-username";
          NIX_GITHUB_PRIVATE_PASSWORD = "your-github-personal-access-token";
        };
        ```
    1. `nix-env -i hub` OR `nix-env -iA nixos.gitAndTools.hub`
    1. `hub clone obsidiansystems/obelisk`
      * NOTE: you must authenticate with hub at least once, because the `ob` command uses `hub` for authentication
      #TODO: Make ob do this itself (either invoke hub automatically or not depend on hub)
1. Install `ob`: `nix-env -f obelisk -iA command`.
   Alternatively, if you prefer not to install to your user nix environment, you can
   enter a shell with the `ob` command available: `nix-shell -A shell`.

## Building
Build the frontend by running

```bash
nix-build -A ghcjs.frontend --out-link frontend-js
```

Now you can try running the backend in GHCi by running

```bash
ob repl backend
```
and then typing

```bash
backend
```

at the GHCi prompt.

Point your web browser at [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) and everything should work.

Feel free to edit the frontend and backend directories as you see fit.

## Developer Tools
To increase developer productivity it is highly recommended to make use of the
`ob watch` command. This will open a live repl that
will compile and refresh itself showing you the latest possible syntax or type errors
as well as any other ghc warnings whenever files within their respective directories
are saved and updated.
